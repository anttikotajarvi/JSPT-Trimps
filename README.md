# JSPT-Trimps
Script for Trimps to keep the browser from deferring JS while the window is not active by emitting a, low, barely[^1] audible sound

While on turned on the tab will emit a quiet, almost inaudible, constant static sound to keep the browser from slowing down JS processing when the tab is not infocus.
Trimps natively does a good job in playing catchup with when the tab comes in focus again but doesnt account for AutoTrimps. AFK performance should be very noticable.

[^1]: Depending on headphones the sound can somewhat literally make you insane or at least induse a mania, the sound can be changed but it cant be empty.  The volume can be tweaked but not by much or else the browser will just ignore it.
